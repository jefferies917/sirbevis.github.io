# Your home of Freemasonry

Welcome to Sir Bevis Lodge No. 5072, a Freemasonry Lodge meeting in Southampton and the Isle of Wight.

Freemasonry is one of the world’s oldest secular social and charitable organisations, with origins that trace back to the skilled stonemasons who built many of the great castles and cathedrals of medieval Europe. While its history is rich, Freemasonry today is very much a modern organisation, focused on personal development, friendship and service to others.

At the heart of Freemasonry are four core values that guide its members throughout life: Integrity, Friendship, Respect and Service. These timeless principles remain just as relevant in the modern world, offering a positive framework for personal conduct, mutual support and community involvement.

Membership is open to men aged 18 and over, from all backgrounds and walks of life. The aim of Freemasonry is not to change who you are, but to help you become the best version of yourself — building character, encouraging self-improvement and supporting members as individuals.

Through its Lodge structure, Freemasonry brings people together with shared values and common purpose. Members form lasting friendships, take part in meaningful traditions and work together to support charitable causes. Collectively, Freemasons are among the largest charitable contributors in the country, donating close to £1 million every week to local and national causes.
