# Your home of Freemasonry

Welcome to Sir Bevis Lodge No. 5072, a Freemasonry Lodge in Southampton and Isle of Wight.

One of the oldest secular social and charitable organisations in the world, modern Freemasonry’s roots lie in the traditions of the medieval stonemasons who built our castles and cathedrals.

For Freemasons, there are four important values that help define their path through life: Integrity, Friendship, Respect and Service. In today’s world filled with uncertainty, these principles ring as true now as they have at any point in the organisation’s history.

Membership is open to men over 18 from all backgrounds and the organisation’s aim is to empower members to be the best they can be – it’s about building character, supporting members as individuals and helping them make a positive contribution to society.

Freemasonry provides a structure for members to come together under these common goals, enabling people to make new friendships, develop themselves and make valuable contributions to charitable causes. We are one of the largest contributors to charitable causes in the country, with a noteworthy almost £1 million donated per week
