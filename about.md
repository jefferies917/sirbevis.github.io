# About Our Lodge

Sir Bevis Lodge is part of a unique members’ organisation that has existed *for over 300 years*. Freemasonry has *no political or religious affiliations* and brings together **men of all ages**, **backgrounds**, **cultures** and **beliefs** who share common values of integrity, respect and fellowship.

At Sir Bevis Lodge, we take our ceremonial traditions seriously, as they connect us to the *long history of Freemasonry* and encourage us to **become better, more thoughtful men**. Our meetings combine meaningful ceremony with an equally important social element. After the formal work of the Lodge, we gather for the festive board, where we enjoy good food and drink, **celebrate achievements**, share conversation and **build lasting friendships**.

We are a very *welcoming* Lodge. Sir Bevis is well suited to those who value tradition but also enjoy getting to know people, taking part in Lodge life, and **sharing a meal and a laugh together**. If you appreciate ceremony as much as camaraderie, you’ll feel very much at home with us.

If you want to learn more or enquire for membership then please contact us here. If you want to learn more about Freemasonry in general then the [Grand Lodge website](https://www.ugle.org.uk/) is a great place to start.
