Being a SW mason this was the *second time* W.Bro. Chris had been the Masonic Centre in Southampton and his first visit to Sir Bevis Lodge. The lodge has adopted a fantastic approach to the membership challenge and is currently in a **plus four position with other candidates in the pipeline**.

The Initiation ceremony was very well done with the Charge given by a *91 year old brother who was initiated himself 66 years ago*.

**Congratulations to our new brother** and all that took part in tonight’s meeting.
