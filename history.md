# History of the Lodge

Founded in 1929, our lodge has served the local community for nearly a century. Sir Bevis is the principal character of English medieval romance. A hero from the mist of legend. Sir Bevois of Hampton were popular books of the middle ages where heroes were valiant, heroines were pure and swords were magical. He was the son of Sir Guy, Earl of Hampton and several versions were told, the French knew him as Beufoes De Hantonne, the Italians Buvo De Antona, the stories were even translated into Scandinavian, Welsh and Slavonic tongues. Some tales report that this ancient hero of Southampton slew a giant, Ascupart, who was terrorising the local countryside and another that he vanquished the giant who later became his slave although there is a tale of a giant skeleton having been dug up when a summer house was being constructed in the middle of the eighteenth century at the top of Bevois Valley. A statue of Sir Bevis stands on the Bargate and many stories were told, his name has been perpetuated in Southampton by a valley, a hill and the Lodge.
